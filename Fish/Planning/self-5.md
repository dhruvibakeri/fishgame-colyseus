Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin placements for setups 
  [`src `](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/e7f645be726dd35d927c29aa1b4923f759c6491c/Fish/Player/strategy.ts#L150-L152)

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns
  [`src`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/e7f645be726dd35d927c29aa1b4923f759c6491c/Fish/Common/src/bestaction.ts#L5-L21)

- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy 
  [`src`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/e7f645be726dd35d927c29aa1b4923f759c6491c/Fish/Common/src/penguin-placement-strategy-tests.spec.ts#L65-L79)

- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy; 
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths 
  
- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtest` test harness:
  - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`
    [`src`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/e7f645be726dd35d927c29aa1b4923f759c6491c/Fish/Common/src/game-tree.ts#L132-L143)
  - where the functionality is used in `xtree`
    [`src`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/e7f645be726dd35d927c29aa1b4923f759c6491c/Fish/Common/lib/index.js#L59-L61)
  - you may wish to submit a `git-diff` for `game-tree` and any auxiliary modules
