## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 3

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of states, including an interpretation:
  in the first part of Fish/Planning/games.md

- a signature/purpose statement of functionality that creates states: 
  - for creating a game state: 
    signature: [`270`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/ce0f87e9fd282a13a08a53bd96153b0c4808b650/Fish/Common/state.js#L270)
    purpose: [`271`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/ce0f87e9fd282a13a08a53bd96153b0c4808b650/Fish/Common/state.js#L271)
    

- unit tests for functionality of taking a turn : [`133`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/ce0f87e9fd282a13a08a53bd96153b0c4808b650/Fish/Common/game-state-function-tests.js#L133)

- unit tests for functionality of placing an avatar : [`26`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/ce0f87e9fd282a13a08a53bd96153b0c4808b650/Fish/Common/game-state-function-tests.js#L26)

- unit tests for functionality of final-state test : [`223`](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/ce0f87e9fd282a13a08a53bd96153b0c4808b650/Fish/Common/game-state-function-tests.js#L223)

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "ce0f87e9fd282a13a08a53bd96153b0c4808b650".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
