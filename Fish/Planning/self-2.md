## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

A fundamental guideline of Fundamentals I, II, and OOD is to design
methods and functions systematically, starting with a signature, a
clear purpose statement (possibly illustrated with examples), and
unit tests.

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of tiles, including an interpretation:

- the data description of boards, include an interpretation:

- the functionality for removing a tile:
  - purpose:
  
  - signature:
  
  - unit tests:

- the functiinality for reaching other tiles on the board:
  - purpose:
  
  - signature:
  
  - unit tests:

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "091e33607838c90c63597808ab23afa6fdc97ff8".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
