## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?

    **No, but it is mentioned in one of our milestones (week 5) and we the Colyseus (our chosen gaming framework) has a way to incorporate "AI" players (through a protocol)**

  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games

    **No, but we mention a way for us to be able to communicate changes in game state from the client to the server, where the information would be taken in by our referee and dealt with accordingly. (under presentation layer, 2nd point)**


  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components

    **Colyseus has a tournament management system where we can manage different "rooms"**

- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games
  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 
  - for running remote tournaments on a network

    **Our plan coalesces all the possibilities above in "Week 5" in our milestones repo.  These possibilities are not individually considered though.**



- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?

    **Yes**

  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?

    **Sentences make a point and one (See [system.pdf](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/rosebud/blob/master/Fish/Planning/system.pdf) point 2 in presentation layer) runs on.**

  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?

    **Each sentence connects ideas from the previous sentence but mentions a new point too.**

  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?

    **All sentences are complete.**

  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)

    **All spellings are correct.**

The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
