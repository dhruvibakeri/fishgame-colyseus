// ----- USAGE -----
// - getPenguinPlacementPosn is used by a player to place its penguin
//    during the placing stage of the game.
// - The function uses a placement strategy where the penguin whose turn it currenly is
//    is in the given game state, places its penguin at the first available free spot 
//    followning a zig zag pattern that starts at the top left corner.

// GameState -> BoardPosn | IllegalAction
// looks for a valid penguin placement position for the player whose turn it currently is in the
// given state. If the player has already placed all its penguins it returns an 'IllegalAction'.
// If there are no valid placement positions left, it also returns an 'IllegalAction'.

 * ------------------------ ASSIGNMENT TEXT --------------------------------------
 *
 * - a choice of action for the player whose turn it is
 *
 * It picks the action that realizes the best gain after looking ahead N > 0 turns
 * for this player in the game tree for the current state.
 *
 * The best gain ater N turns is the highest score a player can make after playing
 * the specified number of turns - assuming that all opponents pick one of the the
 * moves that minimizes the player's gain.
 *
 * *Tie Breaker* If  several diferent actions can realize the same gain, the
 * strategy moves the penguin that has the lowest row number for the place from
 * which the penguin is moved and, within this row, the lowest column number. In
 * case this still leaves the algorithm with more than one choice, the process is
 * repeated for the target field to which the penguins will move. Why is this
 * process guaranteed to stop with a single action?

/**         INTERPRETATION OF OUR BEST GAIN STRATEGY ALGORITHM
 *  - our minimax function takes in:
 *      -  a GameTree 
 *      -  number of turns aka depth
 *      -  player whose turn it currently is aka MAXIMIZING PLAYER
 *      -  player who's score we want to maximize aka MAIN PLAYER
 *      -  an list of 'Move'(s) (initially empty) aka  MAXIMIZING ACTIONS
 * 
 *      - As our base case, we first check:
 *          - if the depth = 0      or 
 *          - if the gameTree given is at a position where the game is OVER.
 *          - If so, we calculate the score of the MAIN PLAYER at that position and return [score, MAXIMIZING ACTIONS]
 * 
 *      - If the depth is not yet 0 or game is NOT OVER we check:
 * 
 *          - if the MAXIMIZING PLAYER is the MAIN PLAYER:
 *              - If so, we set a variable called MAX_EVAL to the lowest value possible
 *              - we then run this algorithm on directly reachable substates with depth - 1
 *              - for every substate, we get a score which we then compare to MAX_EVAL
 *                  and MAX_EVAL gets updated with the greater of the two
 *              - if the score is greater than MAX_EVAL, we also add the action made to get to
 *                  this substate to MAXIMIZING ACTIONS
 *              - after going through all substates, we return [MAX_EVAL, MAXIMIZING ACTIONS]
 * 
 *          - if the MAXIMIZING PLAYER is NOT the MAIN PLAYER:
 *              - If so, we set a variable called MIN_EVAL to the highest value possible
 *              - we then run this algorithm on directly reachable substates with the same depth 
 *              - for every substate, we get a score which we then compare to MIN_EVAL
 *                  and MIN_EVAL gets updated with the lesser of the two
 *              - after going through all substates, we return [MIN_EVAL, MAXIMIZING ACTIONS]
 * 
 * -- our function getBestAction uses minimax and returns the first action in MAXIMIZING ACTIONS
 *    which would represent the best move the MAIN PLAYER should make first.
