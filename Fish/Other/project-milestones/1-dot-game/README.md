# `1 â€” Dot Game`

**Due** Thursday, 02 October 2020, 11:59:59pm

**Delivery** Create a directory called `Fish` in your repository. You will deliver all project milestones in this directory.

Within `Fish`, create a folder dubbed `Planning`. This is where you place the product of the this week's project step: `system.pdf`, the system description, and `milestones.pdf`, the milestone identification.

**Background** We are about to launch a "dot game" company. You have been hired to design and implement the softeare. 

This novel company is for hackers, starting with your friends. The founders and co-COEs noticed how these people are bored and always want to demonstrate their tremendous programming skills.

This company will provide the ideal outlet for them. The company will provide game servers to which these hackers can connect player software and win prizes - for an enormous entry ffee of course. The grand idea is this:

- the company publishes a "plug in" protocol to which automated players must adhere;
- the game servers allow such "AI" players to sign up for tournaments;
- once the sign-up period is over, the servers run the tournament; and
- the owners of the winning player(s) will receive prize money, the losers will be allowed to pay an entry fee for the next tournnament.

Participating hackers must produce robust software because any mistakes will be punished by termination and must produce good strategy algorithms.

> This course focuses on the "robust software" aspects, but we will clearly need some basic game-playing algorithm.

The first game to be offered is called **Fish**.

**Task** You are the engineer, and you need to develop a technical plan.

Your first task is to identify the software components of a complete Fish game system. The description of a component inncludes its purpose, what it represents, and what role it plays in the overall system.

Your second task is to develop a sequence of milestones. Keep in mind that you're working with the CEOs of a startup who must demo intermediate milestones to angel investors (parents, uncles and aunts, grand parents and cousins of N-th degree) with no understanding of technology other than what they can see on a monitor. Identify stages that you can demo and then the components that you need for such demos. Compose a plan accordingly.

Each memo must not exceed one page. You must use an 11-point font (or larger). The white-space margins on your page must be at least 1in wide on all sides.
