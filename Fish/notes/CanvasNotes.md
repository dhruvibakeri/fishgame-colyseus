- Why are we using canvas instead of WebGL? 
  - WebGL might not work well in virtual machines and our delivery system.
  - It also has a steeper learning curve compared to Canvas
- Canvas has a disappointingly low-level API. Can we use a library like 
  fabric.js? Fabric provides simple but powerful object model on top of native methods
